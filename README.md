# Challenge-2019-07

This month's challenge is a bit different! 

Make the coolest fractal program you can think of. Any language, any method, any UI... anything goes. (As I type this I already regret it)

The winner won't by by number of CPU cycles, shortest time, shortest code, but rather by "cool factor". We will be making a bracket where you can vote for your favorite program. 

Submit your code as **_a module_** and we will compile a list for voting later this month.

Submit your modules by midnight ET July 27th.
